# Fibonacci-Sphere

## A container for displaying HTML SVG elements in a rotating sphere

**Check out the CodePen**: https://codepen.io/smonzon14/pen/NWjRZWe
The code uses mouse input to rotate and changes opacity and size based on an element's position on the sphere.

### Notes:

- Resizing page also updates variables.
- DOT_RADIUS is the radius (or half-width) of the given SVG paths and must be user defined. (A later feature could be setting widths for multi-sized SVGs)
- Simply paste an svg into "svg-container" to add it to the collection.
- uncomment the fillStyle line in the Dot class to set one color for all.
